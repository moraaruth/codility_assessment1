# Challenge 1: No ifs no buts(Toy Problem)

- Write a function that accepts two numbers a and b and returns whether a is smaller than, bigger than, or equal to b, as a string.
- You cannot use if statements, and you cannot use the ternary operator ? 

## BDD (Behavior Driven Development)

- Given: Two numbers a and b
- When: a is smaller than, bigger than, or equal to b
- Then: returns whether a is smaller than, bigger than, or equal to b, as a string.

## Example1
- Given: (5, 4) 
- Return: "5 is greater than 4"
## Example2
- Given: (-4, -7)
- Return: "-4 is greater than -7"
## Example3
- Given: (2, 2) 
- Return: "2 is equal to 2"

## PseudoCode:
- Function that accepts two numbers. Given: a and b => (a, b)
- Compare two numbers i.e a and b to know which is greater than the other.
- Return whether a is smaller than, bigger than, or equal to b, as a string
